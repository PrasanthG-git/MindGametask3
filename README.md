I created a game of the mindgame.
In this game have a different types of the image but i insert only the 8 images of the pair.
I used the one array to give the 8 images and next array to concat the first and next array .
and then suffel the array.
 next i create a grid on the 4 row and 4 colomn.
 then insert the suffeled images in the grid .
 using the java script i will create timer that timer run when this site is open.
 the grid images are removed when the images are same .
 if all the matches found the alart message will come and say the time taken to finish the game.
 After tha the reset button will come and then press that button it will restart the game .
